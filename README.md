# cortex-q-learning-test

A couple of example of q-learning with a neural network using the
[Cortex](https://github.com/originrose/cortex) library. The Frozen Lake example requires setting up and running the [OpenAI Gym Http API](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api).

Additional setup for Cortex shouldn't be necessary unless you want to use a GPU.
